 🧬 ML4G Project 1 — Predicting Gene Expression from Epigenomic Signals

> Predict gene expression for unseen cell lines using epigenomic features.
> LightGBM + robust preprocessing, complementary features, and chromosome-aware validation.

This is the **quick start**. For the full pipeline (notebooks, plots, configs, detailed notes), see **`Code submission/README.md`**.

## 🚀 Reproduce My Results

### Option A — Docker (no local setup)

```bash
docker pull deweywang/ml4g-project1:latest

docker run --rm -it \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  deweywang/ml4g-project1:latest
```

Then open **[http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)** (runs without token; use on trusted networks).
Your current folder is mounted to **/workspace** in the container.

---

### Option B — Run Locally (.venv / pip)

> ✅ Everything installs into **`.venv`** and won’t touch your global Python.

```bash
make init                  # Step 1: create venv and install deps
source .venv/bin/activate  # Step 2 (macOS/Linux)
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Step 2 (Windows, WSL2 recommended for pyBigWig)
make lab                   # Step 3: launch JupyterLab
```

Inside JupyterLab: pick **Python (.venv) ml4g_project1** as the kernel.

Extras:

```bash
make clean   # remove the venv and kernel spec
make reset   # clean everything and reinitialize from scratch
```

> Note: `pyBigWig` requires Linux/macOS toolchains. On Windows, use **WSL2 (Ubuntu)** or Docker.

## 📂 Data

The **ML4G_Project_1_Data** folder data is available via **Polybox**:
**Link:** [https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/XJZFdLSZNHpEDLw](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/XJZFdLSZNHpEDLw)
**Password:** `transcription_factor_2025`

Place downloaded data under the repo root (the Docker command above mounts it to `/workspace`).

## 📘 What this repo does (short)

* Loads histone marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K9me3) + DNase (BED + bigWig).
* Preprocesses with **log1p → per-mark z-score** (“log-z”) to reduce outliers/batch effects.
* Engineers promoter↔gene-body, activation↔repression, and cross-layer (BED × bigWig) features.
* Trains **LightGBM** in two stages: binary (non-zero) → rank regression (Spearman-friendly).
* Validates with **LOCO** + chr-aware K-Fold; applies **probability masking**.
* Final ensemble/stacking + ready-to-submit outputs.

👉 Full details, ablations, and SHAP interpretation live in **`Code submission/`**.

## 🎓 Course Context (ETH Zürich)

**263-5351-00L Machine Learning for Genomics (HS2025)**
Lecturer: Prof. Valentina Boeva 
Course goals: ML methods for genomics — TF binding/open chromatin/histone marks, variant effects, expression prediction, folding (RNN/LSTM/Transformers), deconvolution, single-cell imputation/clustering, batch correction, spatial omics, survival analysis.
Prereqs: Intro ML, stats/probability, Python, Unix shell (bio/genomics background helpful but not required).
